## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Express as a means to create a web framework for creating servers used in a note taking application. The motivation for this project was to solidify an understanding of Express.JS and how server routing is used for GET and POST requests. This project was built to create a note taking application that uses back-end server databases created using Express. The problem this project solves is creating an application that uses a developer generated server and API for back-end development.
